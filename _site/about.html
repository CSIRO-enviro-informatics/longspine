                <h1>About LongSpine</h1>
    <p>
        This interface to the models and data assembled by the <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Longitudinal Spine of Government Functions</span> project (LongSpine) which ran in the 2018/2019 Financial Year as part of <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/">CSIRO's Data61</a>'s <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/en/Collaborate-with-us/Government/Platforms-For-Open-Data">Platforms for Open Data (PfOD)</a> series of projects has been created to keep all of its outputs in one place and to demonstrate some of the capabilities that the project facilitated.
    </p>
    <h2 id="projectaim"><a href="#projectaim">&#167;</a> Project Aim <sup><a href="">&uarr;</a></sup></h2>
    <p>
        The aim of LongSpine was to make information about government functions and structure more available and better the better integration of other sources of information on topics such as staffing, budgets and reporting. A key part of the aim was to allow changes in structure and function to be tracked over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project did not seeking to replace any function classification used in the Australian Government, rather it sought to create linkages between functions from different function classification systems and other datasets, building them into a <a href="principles#spine">spine</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the project aimed to demonstrate improved capabilities by implementing a spine, the demonstration of which is in this website, it had to create or enhance harmonised models of its component datasets and vocabularies (see the <a href="models">Models</a> &amp; <a href="data">Data</a> pages) to make them work together and they may be used independently of the spine.
    </p>
    <h2 id="projectaim"><a href="#projectaim">&#167;</a> Future of LongSpine <sup><a href="">&uarr;</a></sup></h2>
    <p>
        There are several small projects in the 2019/2020 Financial Year which are extending on this work. Also, it is possible a LongSpine 2 may be initiated within a year of this project ending (June 2019).
    </p>
    <p>
        This spine demonstration will be maintained for an un-specified amount of time, likely the 2019/2020 Financial Year. The component models are published already (see the <a href="models">Models</a> page) via the <a href="http://www.linked.data.gov.au">Australian Government Linked Data Working group</a> with CSIRO providing interim technical maintenance.  CSIRO is seeking to hand model maintenance over to the agencies that own the systems modelled (National Archives of Australia, the Department of Finance and the Australian Bureau of Statistics)
    </p>
    <p>
        The datasets built (original data interpreted as RDF via use of the dataset's models) are one-time builds so they are published and available on-going but they are static and will not change are the underlying data does. It is hoped that live interpretations of the underlying datasets may produce continually up-to-date RDF versions of them in the future.
